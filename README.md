# Ball

NES Recreation of Nintendo's 1980 Game & Watch game, [Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(video_game)). 

Made for the [Game Genie Game Mini-Jam](https://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=26222), centered on the limitations of 16 KB PRG and a limited predefined CHR.

Programmed in the NES-focused programming language [NESFab](https://github.com/pubby/nesfab). Outside of some of the library functions, all the code is original for this jam.
